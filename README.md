# Dave's Cubic Seasonal Calendar

## Setup

Running `main.py` produces a print out of the current date, and a calendar of twelve months from the current month. Solstices and equinoxes are marked with an asterisk.

The default location is Sydney, Australia. Custom latitude and longitude can be specified as arguments to the `Calendar` class.
